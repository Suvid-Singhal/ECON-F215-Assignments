# ECON F215
This repository serves as my source code, reports and presentations for the course ECON F215 - Computational methods for economics offered in Spring '25

There were 2 assignments in the course
### Assignment 1
We were given NSSO's 68th round dataset and had to analyze the dataset, identify relevand variables and run regressions to solve the given questions. I have not shared the question paper here as it is a property of BITS Pilani.

### Assignment 2
We were given [this research paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054825574) by a Nobel laureate Dr. Abhijit Banerjee. We had to read the paper, analyze it and reestimate the results related to instrumental variable regression for table 4 from the paper.

We had to prepare detailed reports and present our findings through a powerpoint presentation for each of the assignments.

Everything except the assignment question paper, datasets and papers are included in this repository for the referece.

Assignment question paper, datasets and papers are not included as they are not my property and I don't own the rights to them.
